# radtype

My daughter loves to type on my keyboard(s), but the output of a text editor is not much fun for a small child. 
Secondly, I have to guard the modifier/hot keys to make sure she doesn't cause some system issue or send a love 
letter to my boss in Slack.

Enter ðŸ¤™ **radtype** ðŸ¤™ - a fun, silly "game" where all keyboard input affects the screen in unpredictable ways.

**P.S.** Yes, this is also an excuse to try out Rust.
